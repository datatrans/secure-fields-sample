# Secure Fields

Sample code for implementing a visually pleasing credit card transaction form with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

This example is using the [Datatrans Payment JSON API](https://api-reference.datatrans.ch/#tag/v1transactions) and guides you through the backend calls to initialize and authorize transactions.

**Note:** If you're a PCI Proxy customer, please refer to our [Secure Fields initTokenize example](../react-example-initTokenize/) and the [PCI Proxy Documentation](https://docs.pci-proxy.com/collect/secure-fields-js).
