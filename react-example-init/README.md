# Secure Fields

This project contains sample code for implementing a visually pleasing credit card transaction form with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

This component is using the [Datatrans Payment JSON API](https://api-reference.datatrans.ch/#tag/v1transactions)..
This example therefore also guides you through the backend calls to initialize and authorize transactions.
